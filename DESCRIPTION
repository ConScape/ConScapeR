Description: ConScapeR provides a R wrapper to the ConScape.jl library in Julia, which allows the use of ConScape from an R interface. ConScape (i.e. 'connected landscapes') is a software library implemented in the high-performance open-source Julia language to compute landscape ecological metrics — originally developed in metapopulation ecology (such as 'metapopulation capacity' and 'probability of connectivity') — for large landscapes. Moreover,in addition to traditional distance metrics used in ecology (i.e. Euclidean and least-cost distance), ConScape implements the randomized shortest paths framework to represent connectivity along the continuum from optimal to random movements.
